Create env file and set your database name to DB_NAME, set database username to DB_USER, and set database password to DB_PW. To create schema, run 'source db/schema.sql' in mysql console. If you want to seed the database with given seeds or your own, run 'npm run seed'. To run the server after creating database and seeding it, run 'npm start' in the console.
